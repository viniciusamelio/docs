The way you can call our sdk through different languages may vary but the commands will be pretty much the same:

## Init
Adds an empty **localesync.config.json** file and a 'hello world' **translation_fallback.json**

## Gen
Generates your language files from your **translation_fallback.json**

## Upload
Uploads your **translation_fallback.json** content to the server, upserting all languages and strings

## Download
Downloads a **translation_fallback.json** from server, overriding your current file, it will contain the data from the server and all downloaded strings will be in the object format

## Sync
It calls upload, download and gen, following this order. It can be helpful on CI/CD pipelines, but be careful with possible overridings
