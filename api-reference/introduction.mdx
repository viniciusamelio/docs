<Note>
  If you're looking for an easier way to manage your translations, you should look if there's an SDK available, if not, do not worry, it can be pretty easy setup your own service to handle our server actions
</Note>

All endpoints called from SDK's CLI can be accessed as regular http calls from your code


## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using a custom header:

```json
"Repository-token" : "Your API token here"
```
