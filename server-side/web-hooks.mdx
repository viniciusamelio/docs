title: Web Hooks
description: "Get notified when your translations change"
---

On premium workspaces (hobby and pro plans) you can set hooks, which send a request to an URL provided by you, to get notified whenever your repository strings change.

## Payload

There are two possible json formats you get when updating your strings, which must vary depending from where you are editing them.

```json From editor
{
    "type" : "created",
    "at" : "2024-10-10T00:00:0000",
    "by" : "user:testUserIdHere",
    "data" : {
        "id" : "translation:testTranslation01",
        "value" : {
            "value" : "string",
            "plural" : "string"
        },
        "createdAt" : "timestamp",
        "sentence": "sentence:idHere",
        "language" : "language:idHere",
        "createdBy" : "user:userIdHere"
    }
}
```

```json From cli / updating file
{
    "type" : "updated",
    "at" : "2024-10-10T00:00:0000",
    "by" : "user:testUserIdHere",
    "data" : [
            {
            "id" : "translation:testTranslation01",
            "value" : {
                "value" : "string",
                "plural" : "string"
