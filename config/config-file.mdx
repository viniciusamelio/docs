Locale Sync's config file is nothing but a json which must contain all needed metadata from your workspace and/or repository to get things working through our CLI.

To get started, all you need to do is to create a file called **localesync.config.json** at the root of your project.
You'll add your data following this template:

```json localesync.config.json
{
    "repository_id" : "my_repository_id",
    "api_token": "my_api_token"
}

```

You can easily get this from your repository page on "Tokens" tab. If that's your first setup, you may need to generate a new one, you can do it by clicking the "New" button on right side.
